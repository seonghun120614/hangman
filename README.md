# Lab Assignment #3 -- JavaScript

**Project Title:** Hangman Game (3 points)

**Objective:** The goal of the JavaScript practice homework is to
solidify core JavaScript skills, focusing on essentials like variables,
loops, functions, and DOM manipulation. It aims to build practical
abilities in making web pages interactive and applying JavaScript for
dynamic content manipulation.

**Gameplay**: The player tries to guess a word by suggesting English
alphabet letters within a certain number of guesses. Each incorrect
guess brings the hangman drawing closer to completion. The game is won
if the word is guessed before the hangman is fully drawn.

**Requirements:**

The basic requirements for this assignment are as follows:

1.  **Interface Layout**: Utilize the provided HTML file for the game\'s
    interface, which includes specific areas for the hangman drawing,
    the word to be guessed with blanks for unknown letters, and an
    alphabet for letter selection. It is crucial that the HTML file
    remains unedited; instead, focus on utilizing JavaScript and CSS for
    game development tasks such as DOM manipulation, event management,
    validations, and styling. Ensure that all your code is
    well-commented.

2.  **Guess Limit and Hangman Drawing**: Players are permitted up to six
    incorrect letter guesses. With each incorrect guess, a part of the
    hangman will be drawn in the following order: head, trunk, right
    arm, left arm, right leg, and left leg.

3.  **Visual Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback for all
    player actions, including indications for incorrectly guessed
    letters and correctly guessed letters, to enhance user experience
    and game interaction.

4.  **Game Outcome Notifications**: Use alerts to notify players of
    their victory or defeat at the end of the game. This simple method
    ensures players are clearly informed about the game outcome.

5.  **Word Selection**: The word to be guessed should be hardcoded in
    your JavaScript using a variable. Initially, only one word is
    required for this assignment. However, you might consider
    incorporating a selection of words.

**Extra features**:

For a more engaging experience, consider incorporating the following
extra features (optional bonus points might be given. If you get the
maximum score, the bonus points can supplement your previous homeworks).

-   **Custom Alerts**: Instead of using default browser alerts for game
    outcomes, consider creating custom modal dialogs using HTML and CSS
    for a more integrated and visually appealing notification system.

-   **Keyboard Input**: Enhance the game by allowing players to use
    their keyboard to input guesses, in addition to clicking on the
    on-screen alphabet.

-   **Extra words**: As an advanced feature, implement the functionality
    to obtain or generate random words for gameplay. This can
    significantly increase the game\'s replayability and challenge.

**Submission**

1.  **The submission of this lab assignment is through the GitHub
    Classroom platform which registers the repository containing all the
    necessary files for your website. It is imperative that the commit
    history in your repository reflects consistent development progress,
    starting with an initial commit to establish the project baseline,
    followed by a series of subsequent commits that document the
    evolution and progression of your work. Please note that no late
    submissions will be accepted under any circumstances.**

2.  The root directory of the project repository should contain a
    screencast with audio (maximum 2 minutes) in which the game
    functionality is demonstrated (both win and lose conditions).
